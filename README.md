# Biodiversity
This is a capstone project from Codecademy and I will analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.

I would like to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.
